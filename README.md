# Global-Treps-Enterpreneurship-initiative

Welcome to the Global Treps Entrepreneurship Initiative, an innovative project designed to empower local entrepreneurs on a global stage. In this document, we provide you with an overview of our initiative's objectives and key accomplishments in August 2023.

**Project Overview:**

The Global Treps Entrepreneurship Initiative is inspired by the popular TV show "Shark Tank." We aim to create a platform where aspiring entrepreneurs can pitch their ideas to a panel of investors or "sharks." Our vision is to promote and support local entrepreneurs, providing them with the opportunity to showcase their ventures on a global scale.

**Objectives:**

Our initiative is driven by two primary objectives:

1. **Centralized Application and Donation Tracking System:** We are developing a centralized application and Donation Tracking System to streamline the execution of "shark tank" events. This technology will play a pivotal role in facilitating the entire process, from entrepreneur applications to investor contributions.

2. **Organize Four "Shark Tank" Events:** Within the next six months, our goal is to organize and conduct four "shark tank" events. These events will serve as a platform for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas and secure investments, ultimately advancing their businesses.

**Key Accomplishments**

During August 2023, I had the privilege of leading various aspects of the Global Treps Entrepreneurship Initiative. Here are the key accomplishments and contributions:

1. **Comprehensive Initiative:** I oversaw the development of a comprehensive initiative that encompassed several critical elements, including:
   - **Weighted Scoring Model:** Designed to objectively evaluate project opportunities.
   - **Business Case:** Crafted to secure support and resources.
   - **Project Charter:** Outlining goals, scope, timelines, and stakeholders.
   - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Providing a detailed task breakdown.
   - **Scope Validation and Change Control Strategies:** Ensuring scope adherence.
   - **RACI Matrix:** Clarifying roles and responsibilities.
   - **Risk Register and Probability Matrix:** Proactively addressing uncertainties.

2. **Informed Decision-Making:** The initiative's structure enabled informed decisions, driving the promotion of global entrepreneurship through events, funding, and digital platforms.

**Conclusion:**

The Global Treps Entrepreneurship Initiative is an exciting endeavor with the potential to empower local entrepreneurs and foster global innovation. Our commitment to developing a centralized application and organizing multiple "shark tank" events within the next six months reflects our dedication to this mission.
